#Problem Statement
Let $R$ be a relation with a set $A$ of attributes and let $r$ be an instance of $R$. 
A {\em functional dependency} (FD) is an expression of the form $X \to Y$, where
$X \subseteq A$ and $Y \in A$. $X$ is called the {\em determinant set} and $Y$ is called
the {\em dependent attribute}. The dependency is {\em valid} in the instance $r$ if and
only if for every pair of rows (tuples) $t, u \in r$, whenever $t[B]=u[B]$ for all
$B \in X$, it is also the case that $t[Y]=u[Y]$. A FD $X \to Y$ is called {\em trivial}
if $Y\in X$. Our problem can be formally stated as follows: \textit{given a relation
$R$ and an instance $r$ of $R$, find all non-trivial FDs that are valid in $r$}. 


So, given two FDs $X\to B$ and $Y\to B$ as in the proposition, the latter can be
considered redundant, in the sense that if the former has been found the latter does
no longer need to be considered, since it follows from the former. This consideration
leads us to give the following
\begin{definition}
Given a relation instance $r$, a FD $X\to B$ that is valid in $r$ is said to be {\em 
minimal} if no other FD $Y\to B$ is valid in $r$ with $Y$ a proper subset of $X$.
\end{definition}

So the practical formulation of our problem is as follows: \textit{given a relation
$R$ and an instance $r$ of $R$, find all non-trivial, minimal FDs that are valid in $r$}.
