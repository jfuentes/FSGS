Python program

This program generates an instance of relation to produce the worst case in finding maximal refutations.

Given an instance of relation r of R and a set of attributes A. A refutation is found if given two tuples
(rows) u and v, u[Y]!=v[Y] and u[B]!=v[B] where Y is in A and B is a subset of A\Y.
